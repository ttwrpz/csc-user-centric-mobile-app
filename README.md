## Prerequisites

Before cloning the project, make sure you have the following installed:

### Required

* **Flutter SDK**
  [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
* **Git**
* **Android SDK** (installed via Android Studio or standalone)
* **Xcode** (macOS only, for iOS development)

Verify your setup:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Resolve any issues before proceeding.

---

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ttwrpz/csc-user-centric-mobile-app.git
cd csc-user-centric-mobile-app
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

## Project Structure

This is a standard Flutter project:

* `lib/` — application source code
* `android/` — Android platform module (auto-generated by Flutter)
* `ios/` — iOS platform module
* `web/` — Web platform module
* `pubspec.yaml` — dependencies & assets
* `.idea/`, `.iml` — **NOT committed** (generated by IDEs)

---

## Setup Using VS Code (Flutter Plugin)

### 1. Install VS Code Extensions

Install the following extensions:

* **Flutter**
* **Dart**

(Installing Flutter automatically installs Dart.)

---

### 2. Open the Project

```text
File → Open Folder → user_centric_mobile_app
```

Open **the project root** (the folder containing `pubspec.yaml`).

VS Code will automatically:

* Detect the Flutter project
* Enable Dart analysis
* Configure run/debug support

---

### 3. Select a Device

* Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` / `Cmd + Shift + P`
* Run **Flutter: Select Device**
* Choose an emulator or physical device

---

### 4. Run the App

* Press **F5**, or
* Run:

```bash
flutter run
```

---

## Setup Using IntelliJ / Android Studio

### 1. Install Required Plugins

In **Settings / Preferences → Plugins**:

* **Flutter**
* **Dart** (installed automatically with Flutter)

Restart the IDE after installation.

---

### 2. Open the Project

```text
File → Open → csc-user-centric-mobile-app
```

**Important:**
Open the **project root**, not the `android/` subfolder.

---

### 3. Configure Flutter SDK (First Time Only)

If prompted:

* Click **Configure Flutter SDK**
* Select your local Flutter SDK path

Android Studio will automatically:

* Detect the Flutter project
* Import the Android module
* Generate `.idea` and `.iml` files locally

(No files need to be committed.)

---

### 4. Select Run Configuration

* Choose the auto-generated **Flutter** run configuration
* Select an emulator or connected device

---

### 5. Run the App

* Click **Run ▶**
* Or use:

```bash
flutter run
```

---

## Platform Notes

### Android

* Android module is regenerated from `android/`
* Gradle sync happens automatically
* No manual setup required

### iOS (macOS only)

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
flutter run
```

Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` **only if debugging iOS-specific issues**.

---

## Common Issues

### Flutter not detected

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Ensure Flutter is in your `PATH`.

---

### IDE shows missing modules / files

* Close the IDE
* Reopen the project root
* Run:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

---

## IDE Files and Version Control

This project intentionally does **not** commit:

* `.idea/`
* `.iml` files

These are **auto-generated** by IDEs and recreated on import.

Only source code and configuration required to build the app are versioned.
